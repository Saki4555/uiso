# Build & Deployment

This guide covers the essential steps for building and deploying your application.

## Building Your Application

To build your application for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the `dist` or `.next` directory.

## Environment Variables

Make sure to set up your environment variables before building:

```bash
# .env.local
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourapp.com
```

## Deployment Options

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure your build settings
3. Deploy with automatic CI/CD

### Docker Deployment

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
"COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Performance Optimization

- Enable compression
- Optimize images
- Use CDN for static assets
- Implement caching strategies

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor your application using:

- Error tracking (Sentry)
- Performance monitoring (Vercel Analytics)
- Uptime monitoring
